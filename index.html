					<div>Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and use of machines. It involves the application of principles from physics, mathematics, and materials science to the creation of products, devices, and systems that are used in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, and healthcare. Mechanical engineers often collaborate with other engineers and technicians, as well as with product designers, marketers, and other professionals, to bring their designs to life. They also use computer-aided design (CAD) software and simulations to create virtual models of their designs and test them before they are built.</div>
