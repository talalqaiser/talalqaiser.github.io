                        <p style="text-align:left;">Paragliding is a type of recreational aviation that involves gliding through the air while suspended in a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched aircraft known as a paraglider. I have earned a beginner level certificate in paragliding. Thats me in the picture</p><br>

                        <p style="text-align:right;">Archery is a sport and recreational activity that involves using a bow to shoot arrows at a target. The sport of archery dates back thousands of years and was originally used for hunting and warfare. Recreational archery is often done at archery ranges or outdoor settings, and may involve shooting at targets or other objects. I earned basic-level target shooting training for archery.</p></br>

					<p style="font-size: 18px">I always find it enthusiastic to try different adventurous sports. My enthusiasm and love for sports motivate me to try new things. I used to go for <b>cliff diving</b> during my time when i was doing bachelors. I love to <b>explore nature</b> and capture it using my lens. I enjoy going for a <b>hike</b>. I love to spend my leisure time going out for good hiking spots nearby. By getting involved in these kind of activities made me physical fit. It helped me in assessing risks and made me strong enough to overcome diificult situations and challenges. It helped me to develop an appreciation for and understanding of the environment. Making quick and effective decisions is often crucial, and helped me to develop decision-making skills and the ability to operate under pressure.</p>
